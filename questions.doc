should i put the dimensions in technical production model?
if yes , should i add sth like cutting the deck in the cycles?

should i have cost for home delivery? or it's better to just have price

and the cost in the technical production model is diffrent from the price model table - 
because in the tpm we have some production cost , so for the final cost i should sum all of the cost in my project?

does the level in the technical production model are true?
